1. Knowledge of MVC development.
2. Ability to follow PSR standards, specifically 0 to 2.
3. Knowledge of database best practices.
4. Ability to create simple but effective user interfaces (use of front-end frameworks are acceptable).
5. Show us DRY, extensible development. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
You must avoid using an open source PHP framework, but plugin and open source libraries are acceptable.
